# elvis

This is a thirdparty github repo for the elvis text editor originally written
by Steve Kirkendall and published on ftp://ftp.cs.pdx.edu/pub/elvis/

Its main purpose is preserving the source code of the various historic Elvis
releases and collect bugfixes to the last version (2.2_1).

The elvis documentation can be found
[here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/mbert/elvis/blob/master/README.html).

There is also an [unofficial home page](http://elvis.the-little-red-haired-girl.org).
